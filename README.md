# 🥗 Nourish Connect – Bridging Food Donors and Those in Need

## 🌟 About the Project

**Nourish Connect** is a MERN stack web platform developed to reduce food wastage by connecting individuals and organizations willing to donate surplus food with verified NGOs and volunteers. This platform ensures the timely distribution of leftover food to those in need.

## 🎯 Motivation

Every day, tons of edible food go to waste while millions of people struggle with hunger. This project aims to create a bridge between food donors and people who need it, ensuring:
- Reduction in food wastage
- Convenient food donation system
- Quick access for NGOs and volunteers to collect food and help the needy

## 💡 Features

- 👤 **User Authentication** (Sign Up/Login)
- 🎁 **Easy Donation Form** for leftover food
- 📊 **Dashboard** to manage and view donations
- 👨‍💼 **Admin Panel** to manage users, NGOs, and donations
- 🚚 **Volunteer/NGO Interface** for accepting and marking donations
- 📍 **Location Filtering**

## 🔧 Tech Stack

| Technology        | Purpose                     |
|------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Frontend**     | React.js with Vite          |
| **Backend**      | Node.js + Express.js        |
| **Database**     | MongoDB                     |
| **Authentication** | JWT (JSON Web Tokens)    |
| **Styling**      | Tailwind CSS / Custom CSS   |
| **Version Control** | Git & GitHub             |

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Donors and NGOs/Volunteers register and log in.
2. Donors fill in food details including quantity, location, and timing.
3. Admin oversees all user activity and donation statuses.
4. NGOs/Volunteers can accept donations based on their location and availability.
5. Food gets collected and distributed to those in need.

## 📌 Methodology

- Developed responsive UI using **React.js** with Tailwind CSS.
- Built backend API with **Node.js** and **Express.js**.
- Implemented secure login/authentication using **JWT**.
- Used **MongoDB** for storing users, donations, and roles.
- Dashboard system for each role (Donor, Volunteer, Admin).
- Handling data with RESTful architecture.
